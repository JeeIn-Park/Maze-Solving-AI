# Maze Solving AI with Efficient Pathfinding

## prolog_grid_world

**Project Duration:** November 2023 â€“ December 2023

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI for solving maze problems on grids using pathfinding algorithms in Prolog. The AI is designed to efficiently navigate agents through various maze scenarios, optimising both pathfinding speed and memory usage.

## Features

- **Accelerated Pathfinding:** 
  - Implemented advanced pathfinding algorithms to speed up the process of finding optimal paths for agents in different maze configurations.
  - Optimised memory usage to handle complex scenarios efficiently.

- **Multi-Agent Utilisation:**
  - Enhanced maze-solving capabilities by utilising multiple agents simultaneously.
  - Effectively addressed edge cases where traditional single-agent approaches might fail.
