# Maze Solving AI with Efficient Pathfinding

## prolog_grid_world

**Project Duration:** November 2023 â€“ December 2023

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an AI for solving maze problems on grids using pathfinding algorithms in Prolog. The AI is designed to efficiently navigate agents through various maze scenarios, optimising both pathfinding speed and memory usage.

## Features

- **Accelerated Pathfinding:** 
  - Implemented advanced pathfinding algorithms to speed up the process of finding optimal paths for agents in different maze configurations.
  - Optimised memory usage to handle complex scenarios efficiently.

- **Multi-Agent Utilisation:**
  - Enhanced maze-solving capabilities by utilising multiple agents simultaneously.
  - Effectively addressed edge cases where traditional single-agent approaches might fail.


## Installation

### 1. Download and Extract the Project

- Download the project from the following link:
  [Maze-Solving-AI.zip](https://github.com/JeeIn-Park/Maze-Solving-AI/raw/main/Maze-Solving-AI.zip)
- Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your desired location on your machine.

### 2. Install SWI-Prolog

- Download and install SWI-Prolog by following the instructions on the official website:
  [SWI-Prolog Installation](https://www.swi-prolog.org/)

### 3. Download and Set Up GridWorld Library

- Download the GridWorld library files and skeleton submission files from Blackboard.
- Unzip these files on your working machine. These files extend and replace the library code from earlier Prolog labs.
- The setup consists of a file loader `ailp.pl` that allows you to run different parts of the project.

### 4. Running the Project

- **Linux:**
  1. Navigate to the library root folder containing the `ailp.pl` file.
  2. Run the following command in a bash terminal:
     ```bash
     chmod +x ailp.pl
     ./ailp.pl cw partn
     ```
  
- **Windows:**
  1. Open the `cmd` or `PowerShell` terminal, or double-click `ailp.pl` in an explorer window.
  2. Run the following command:
     ```bash
     swipl ailp.pl cw partn
     ```
  - Alternatively, run:
     ```bash
     swipl-win ailp.pl cw partn
